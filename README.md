Goblinscomic Discord Bot Cog for RedBot v3

It is an RPG suit inspired by the amazing Webcomic (www.goblinscomic.org) intended for fun and merryment on the associated discord server.

To set up, make sure to create both the folder and an empty users.json in your redbot/cogs/gobcog/folder. 
(An empty json file contains only: {})
This file will hold all the user data for the characters.
